# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data Course Project 

# The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

# The data for this project used the UCI HAR Dataset. 

# The original data can be found at: 
# https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 


# The dataset included the following files (other files were included in the dataset but these were
# the only ones of interest for this project):

# README.txt
# features_info.txt - info about the variables
# features.txt - list of the features
# activity_labels.txt - links the class labels with activity names
# train/X_train.txt - Training set data
# train/y_train.txt - Training labels
# test/X_test.txt - Test set data
# test/y_test.txt - Test labels
# train/subject_train.txt - Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity
# train/subject_test.txt - Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity

# Files I created for the project were:

# run_analysis.R - the tidy data set script
# Codebook.md - a description of the variables, summaries calculated, units, other relevant information
# README.md - this README file
# tidydata.txt - tidy data file generated from the tidy data set script
